## Using the joint regressor from the paper
The weights for the joint regressor from the paper are provided in ```models/retrained_J_Regressor.pt```.  

## Training a new joint regressor
The code for training a new joint regressor is provided in ```scripts/optimize.py```. Pseudo ground truth poses are initialized by [SPIN](https://github.com/nkolot/SPIN) estimates. The poses are iteratively optimized to be closer to the ground truth 3D joints while remaining realistic as according to the pose discriminator. These optimized poses are then used to supervise the new joint regressor. In theory this should be able to be applied to any dataset with corresponding ground truth 3D joints.
